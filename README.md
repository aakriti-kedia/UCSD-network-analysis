# Examining Lower Latency Routing with Overlay Networks

In today’s rapidly expanding digital land- scape, where access to timely online content is paramount to users, the underlying network infrastructure and latency performance signif- icantly influence the user experience. We present an empirical study of the current Inter- net’s connectivity and the achievable latencies to propose better routing paths if available. Understanding the severity of the non-optimal internet topology with RIPE Atlas stats, we conduct practical experiments to demonstrate that local traffic from the San Diego area to the University of California, San Diego reaches up to Los Angeles before serving responses. We examine the traceroutes and build an ex- perimental overlay network to constrain the San Diego traffic within the city to get better round-trip time latencies.
